Hello and welcome to the repo for MLGUI. This project is in the very early stages but is still under active development as of the week of 11/29/2020. The goal of this project is to allow someone even with little to no coding background to be able to build and train a machine learning model. For me, it is an opportunity for me to display my current technical skills as well and a multi facet project to continue to build out and apply new skills. If you are interested in learning more about the project, would like to contribute, or just have some feedback, I can be reached at Jon.Wolgamott@gmail.com
